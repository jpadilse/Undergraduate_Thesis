# Summary of steps:

- Import U.S. Call Report database, macroeconomic and financial uncertainty indexes from Jurado et al. (2015), and FED's factors from Matlab code.

- Change the database for to allow two business cycles or more for each bank. The average length of the business cycle is retrieved from NBER for the period 1945-2009: 69.5 months (trought from previous trought).

- Delete missing values (listwise deletion) because the hardware requirements for carry on multiple imputation are too high (it is  deleted all observations for each bank with al least one missing value).

- Merge the databases by the date of each observation (quarterly). For the monthly series is chosen the observation of the months 3, 6, 9 and 12. 

Note: To join months of the different series is assumed that 1960/01/31 is equal to 1960/01/01 in her month, i.e. January.

- Calculate the growth rate of commercial and industrial loans for each bank. This is done with the explicit formula $\frac{x_{t} - x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}}$ instead of numeric aproximation $\Delta \ln (x_{t})$ because the percentages are too high (therefore the aproximation is innacurate).

Note: The zero values in the serie were replaced with the minimum value in the sample ($1$) for to allow calculate the growth rates.

- The sample was split in a training set (80 \%) and a testing set (20 \%) for carry on a correct confirmatory analysis.

- Finally, a plot for the distribution of the uncertainty coefficient --for each differente index-- estimated for OLS.

$$
  gCILoans_{t} = Index_{t} + Factors_{t}
$$

where, 

- $gCILoans_{t}$: The growth rate of commercial and insdustrial loans.

- $Index_{t}$: Uncertainty Index --one of macroeconomic (h = 1, 3, 12) or financial (h = 1, 3, 12)--.

- $Factors_{t}$: Factors estimated from FRED-MD.

# Questions

1. Should I graph the plots with other type of loans (real state loans or personal loans) as dependent variable?

2. Should I graph the plots with other type of unerctainty indexes?

3. Should I use quantile regression instead of OLS?
