I propose a monthly index of non-asset-market uncertainty. The index is constructed through a approximate dynamic factor model with several main uncertainty indexes as data. This strategy considerably reduces extreme movements in the level of uncertainty, which is more appealing with theory. Likewise, I compare the new index with indicators of uncertainty and estimate the impact of an uncertainty shock on the dynamics of macroeconomic variables.
